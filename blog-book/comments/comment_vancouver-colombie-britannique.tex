  So nice to read and see Beautiful British Columbia through your eyes!
  It was such joy to have you and Elida here for two weeks from the
  moment you landed and I drove the car without the keys until you had
  to hop in a car and drive us and our friends to the Belgian Restaurant
  Chambar ( an institution here in Vancouver for years) and we made you
  join us before you headed back to the house...and all the wonderful
  guitar lessons and life lessons you ended up teaching our boys by them
  just hanging out with you! We will never forget those beautiful days
  and we still talk about you two! Now on this blog you were too modest
  in not writing more about the treacherous Grouse Grind and you must
  have a photo from the top after you finished the straight vertical
  climb! Also I wish we had a photo of the full turkey on the
  Thanksgiving photo ðŸ˜„\\
  As you say it was a shame that we didn't get the chance to go to the
  island and the Juan de Fuca passage , but that's for your next time!
  Start planning! Bon Voyage pour le reste de votre adventures...Love
  from the Priatel's
